# introduction
We consider the vision-based control of robots. In vision-based robotics, a robot's state is inferred from visual data and utilised in conjunction with a control strategy to carry out intended activities. There are three key elements of vision-based robot control:
- State representation learning
- Dynamical modelling
- Control strategies

These three tasks are often decoupled and determined separately. In addition to learning useful dynamical models, separating these elements requires us to learn action policies through reinforcement learning, or use model predictive control strategies. In [Jaques et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01959), the authors argue that decoupling these elements places unnecessary computational burden on control. Instead, they propose considering them jointly, by introducing additional inductive priors that simplify downstream control.

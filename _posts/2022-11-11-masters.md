# Introduction
We consider the vision-based control of robots. In vision-based robotics, a robot's state is inferred from visual data and utilised in conjunction with a control strategy to carry out intended activities. There are three key elements of vision-based robot control:
- State representation learning
- Dynamical modelling
- Control strategies

These three tasks are often decoupled and determined separately. In addition to learning useful dynamical models, separating these elements requires us to learn action policies through reinforcement learning, or use model predictive control strategies. In [Jaques et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01959), the authors argue that decoupling these elements places unnecessary computational burden on control. Instead, they propose considering them jointly, by introducing additional inductive priors that simplify downstream control. The resultant model allows us to apply well-known feedback control using the embeddings.

In the rest of this blog post, we'll briefly go over the three aforementioned things that we need to control robots from vision. We'll start with a very quick recap of basic control theory.


# Feedback control
In real robotic control scenarios where we have access to proprioceptive information, it is typical to use simple closed-loop control to direct our process variables $$y(t)$$ towards their setpoints $$r(t)$$ using the error $$e(t)$$. The process variable (also called the state) can be a scalar or vector quantity. When the state is a vector of $$\mathbb{R}^D$$, the error will also be a vector of $$\mathbb{R}^D$$; depending on the scenario this can be considered as $$D$$ parallel control loops (there might be some correlation between state variables depending on the situation)

The typical controller used in feedback control is the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller:

$$
u(t) = K_\text{p} \, e(t) + K_\text{i} \, \int_0^t e(\tau) \, \text{d}\tau + K_\text{d} \, \frac{\text{d} \, e(t)}{\text{d}t} \, .
$$

The gain terms $$K_\text{p}, K_\text{i} \text{ and } K_\text{d}$$ contribute distinctively to the response of the controller: the proportional term guides the process variable directly towards its setpoint; the derivative term introduces inertia in the actuation, leading to smoother control trajectories; and the integral term is generally used to eliminate steady-state error.

The use of PID control is widespread and considered to be the golden standard for simple feedback control because it incorporates the proportional, derivative and integral modes and it is simple to implement and tune.

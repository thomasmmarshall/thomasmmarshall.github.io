# introduction
We consider the vision-based control of robots. In vision-based robotics, a robot's state is inferred from visual data and utilised in conjunction with a control strategy to carry out intended activities. There are three key elements of vision-based robot control:
- State representation learning
- Dynamical modelling
- Control strategies

# variational recurrent neural network

# newtonian variational autoencoder
